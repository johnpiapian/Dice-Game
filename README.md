# extraCredit_JAVA
This is one of my favorite pieces of code thus far and is one of my very first java projects. The reason it is posted is that the project taught me a new way to tackle certain programming challenges. 

The program generates a random number between 1-6(basically represents a dice), and do it five times for each player. The game consists of two players namely "computer" and "player." The winner is determined by the player who secures the highest number of a kind(i.e., 1 two times, 4 three times), and if they both got the same amount(count) of a kind, then it is decided upon whoever got the highest value(1-6) of that kind.
