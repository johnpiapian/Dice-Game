# extraCredit_JAVA
This is one of favorite piece of code so far as it was one of my very first java projects, and I just thought it was really interesting. Plus, it was a creatively challenging piece of puzzle to solve. 

What this piece of code does is that it generates a random number between 1-6(basically represents a dice), and do it five times for each player. The game consists of two players namely "computer" and "player," although the word "player" doesn't represent a user here. The winner is determined by the player which secure the highest number of the same kind(e.g 1 two times, 4 three times), and if they both got the same number of the same kind then it is decided upon whoever got the highest value(1-6) of the kind.
