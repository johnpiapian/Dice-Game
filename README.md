This project is posted here as it made me realize how seemingly simple solutions and mindset can be helpful in programming. It is significant to me as it taught me a new way to tackle certain programming problems and challenges.  

The program generates a random number between 1-6(represents a dice), and do it five times for each player. The game consists of two players namely "computer" and "player." The winner is determined by the player who secures the highest number of a kind(i.e., 1 two times, 4 three times), and if both players drew the same amount(count) of a kind, then the winner is decided upon whoever drew the highest value(1-6) of the kind.
